## Directions

### Make The Jam

* In a large pan with high walls, cook the bacon.
* Work in batches to avoid overlap.
* Once bacon is cooked, allow to cool then roughly chop.
* Pour out all but about 1 tablespoon worth of drippings from the pan.
* Heat the pan, and add onions.
* Cook onions until they become translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.
* Add garlic and cook for 1 additional minute.
* Pour in beer and apple cider vinegar.
* De-glaze the pan using a wooden spoon.
* Add brown sugar, chopped bacon, crushed tomatoes, salt, and pepper.
* Stir well and bring to a boil.
* Cover with offset lid and reduce heat to a simmer.
* Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated and a thick, chunky jam remains, about 1 hour.

### Make The Mac And Beer Cheese

* Cook macaroni according to directions on the box.
* Heat a pot over medium-high heat and add butter.
* When butter has melted, whisk in flour to create roux.
* Cook until it bubbles and turns a gold colour.
* Slowly add milk and beer while whisking.
* Add white cheddar and sharp cheddar slowly, stirring constantly until mixture is smooth.
* Lower heat to medium and stir additional 5 minutes.
* Add salt, black pepper and other spices as desired.
* Stir in cooked macaroni.

### Assemble The Sliders

* Heat a large pan over medium heat.
* Butter one side of each slice of the baguette.
* Place a piece of cheese on the un-buttered side of one slice of the baguette.
* Scoop a generous amount of Mac And Beer Cheese on top of the slice of cheese.
* Place the buttered side down in the hot pan.
* Place another piece of cheese on top of the Mac And Beer Cheese.
* Top each with another slice of baguette that has been spread on the un-buttered side with Bacon, Beer, And Tomato Jam.
* Fry until browned and cheese slice has begun to melt.
* Carefully flip and repeat.
* Serve warm.
